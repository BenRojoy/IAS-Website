    <p class="text-center" style="margin: 0px 30px;"><br><br><br>Talking about Moon Race, who do you think is having an upper edge, USA<br>or the Soviet Union. Now let me take you through some fascinating facts which<br>pioneered the impossible to possible. Let me introduce ‘SPUTNIK’ the world’s<br>first
        artificial satellite which was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957,<br>making them a space research giants.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The ‘LUNA 2’ was the first spacecraft to reach the Lunar orbit launched<br>again by the Soviet Union in 1959. But
        ‘LUNA 9’ of the ‘LAVOCHKIN’ which is the<br>space agency of the Soviet Union was the first spacecraft to land on the moon<br>surface. The US, though had lots of unsuccessful attempts, Apollo 8 which was<br>the first crewed mission which was successful
        in reaching the moon’s orbit but<br>failed to bring the crew members back as engine failed while returning to earth.<br><br>Obviously USSR and US were in a cold-war in terms of the space research,<br>here the Russians even though had many unsuccessful
        attempts initially but<br>managed to bite the dust and proved that they were more advanced and developed<br>than the United States in the case of space research. <br><br>In 1969, history was made by NASA, Neil Aiden<br>Armstrong of Apollo 11 was
        the first person to land on the moon. This<br>successful mission was followed by Apollo 12,13,14 etc.. all turned up to be<br>successful. During 1970-75 period, NASA and USSR joined forces together and<br>guess what…!!! they created an ‘INTERNATIONAL
        SPACE STATION’ which was used to<br>dock the carriers.<br><br>This great achievements by the two nations had set up a bar for other countries<br>to take space research more seriously. Japan, after unsuccessful attempts had<br>joined forces with
        the NASA and successfully launched ‘CLEMENTINE’. This paved<br>way for Japan to start their own research organization called ‘ISAS’, later<br>renamed as Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency(JAXA).<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Soon, the European Union decided
        to build their own space research<br>organization and there it is.. ‘European Space Agency’ was created comprising<br>of more than 20 European countries. Their First mission being ‘SMART-1’ was<br>successful. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>The Chinese
        who always wanted to become the superpower created their own<br>space research agency named ‘CHINA NATIONAL SPACE ADMINISTRATION’. They<br>launched their lunar orbiter ‘CHANG’LE-1’ in 2007 which was successful. They<br>had claimed that their space
        carrier was cheapest of all the launched space<br>vehicles.<br><br>Out of all odds, here comes India, a developing country which has a<br>poverty of 28% into the battle between the developed nations. Guess what, we<br>build the cheapest lunar
        orbiter ever made, even giants like NASA, ESA,<br>LAVOCHKIN couldn’t design a cheap launch vehicle. The ‘INDIAN SPACE RESEARCH<br>ORGANIZATION(ISRO)’ is India’s space agency and history was made. The<br>‘CHANDRAYAAN-1’ was the first lunar mission
        of ISRO and it was successful.<br>Using Chandrayaan, we discovered ‘water ice’ on the surface of the moon. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>A small private agency called LuxSpace in Luxembourg, had joined the<br>party with a successful misson ‘Manfred Memorial
        Moon Mission’ which created a<br>buzz as Luxembourg is a very small country in Europe and they had scaled<br>something unachievable.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Concluding </strong><br><br><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><br>As we discussed the race
        to the moon isn’t a matter of science but it<br>was a battle for prestige too. Even though USSR’s Lavochkin was the first<br>agency to successfully land an orbiter on the moon, the US had the upper hand<br>as they were the first ones to successfully
        land a crew orbiter and they took<br>the privilege of being the first agency to land a Human on <br><br>the surface of the moon. Moon project was a dream project for every<br>other country and soon they started their own space agencies and started
        to<br>launch their own Space vehicles. The Moon Race had set up standards for space<br>research and scientists are working on the settlement of humans in moons.<br>Whichever country discovers environment suitable for human life on the moon<br>will
        be the next super power. So the Race is on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br></p>
