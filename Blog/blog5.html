    <p style="margin: 0px 30px;"><br>…Oh! The Soviet is advancing up… what a jab into the American…He’s down!&nbsp;...oh he’s getting up…trying to work his way through..but the Soviet is too tough..Oh wait! What an uppercut…and the Soviet is down!..the American has done it!!..Sounds
        like a Rocky IV movie commentary? Actually this is&nbsp;me describing the Spectacular Moon Race in the 1960s between Lavochkin/OKB-1 and NASA leading to the giant leap for mankind.<br>Growing up in a house filled with religious and mythical stories
        had me believing that moon was actually a god watching over us at night and guarding us against demons…until my 1st grade teacher struck me with a stupid story that moon was actually a big piece of rock orbiting earth due to a thing called gravity!<br>Oh
        she didn’t stop there…she also said that people have walked on the moon and some kid screamed out the name of the first guy to do that too!<br>This lead to an intense discussion in my house where my parents tried their best to give the simplest
        scientific explanation to a 6 year old boy who hung on to the question that how can “Chandra” visit the “Devalaya” if he’s a piece of rock with no legs?!THE OG RACE<br>The world had different notions and beliefs about the moon. Some people still
        have and don’t believe that the moon missions are true.<br>When President John F. Kennedy announced that America will be trying to touch the moon…for him it was more of a political move to re-establish the USA as the scientific leader of the world
        by surpassing the Soviet Union who had just sent Yuri Gagarin orbiting the earth.<br>But in 1969, the moment Neil Armstrong’s foot touched the soil of the moon… Science shifted up a gear in our world.<br>From Luna 9 to Chandrayaan-2&nbsp;, Aerospace
        engineering and organizations have flourished, coming up with new technologies and ideas for countries to plant their flag upon our natural satellite.THE AFTER-RACE<br>Well, lunar missions became the ultimate show of technological advancement
        of a country. Basically…landing a rover on the moon successfully is like getting an Oscar for how good a country’s scientific mind is.<br>After the competition between America and the Soviet side cooled off…several countries tried to touch the
        moon.On 24th January 1990, Japan became the first country other than these two superpowers to orbit the moon. Japan’s lunar flyby- Hiten, successfully placed itself in the selenocentric orbit but its orbiter crashed into the moon and failed to
        recover any data.Then Japan and NASA conducted various flybys in the 90s. Japan eventually sent their own successful orbiter in 2007 as the part of the SELENE mission.Watching Japan and NASA rub shoulders with the moon, encouraged the European
        Space Agency… which was founded together in 1975 by various European countries like West Germany, France, Italy, etc... to have a go for it.The ESA launched the SMART-1, manufactured by the Swedish Space Corporation in 2003 which impacted the
        moon on 2006.NASA continued to send successful probes and orbiters to the moon and this had a huge part on making them the most successful space agency in the world.When superpowers and unions made their mark on the moon, wannabe superpowers will
        definitely load their guns too right?China entered the scene with a bang&nbsp;. Their orbiter “Chang’e 1” lifted off in 2007, impacted the moon in 2009 and that was just a beginning for them.As this race got hotter and hotter, India launched the
        Chandrayaan mission, with Chandrayaan-1&nbsp;, the first lunar probe launched in October 2008. It proved the presence of Lunar water and was officially terminated in 2009.The next few years went by with NASA and CNSA(China) battling to make their
        mark on discoveries. That was when Luxembourg… a small nation, an underdog, caught all of the world’s attention by successfully conducting a flyby.Luxspace’s Manfred Memorial Moon Mission, launched on 23 October 2014, became the first private
        lunar probe to successfully flyby the moon. The probe also surprised everyone by transmitting until November 2014 which was four times of its expected lifetime.NASA and CNSA continued to launch new mission and CNSA also succeeded in soft landing
        on the far side of the moon with Chang’e 4 in 2018.<br>2019 saw Beresheet launched by Israel…which is the first privately funded lunar lander mission…crash land into the Moon’s surface due to engine failure. India’s Chandrayaan-2 was also launched
        in late July, which also crash landed due to software glitch.Even though many lunar missions were there, Only three countries have soft-landed on the moon:- USA,USSR and China.CONCLUSION<br>As time passes, the lunar race will only get hotter.
        With China’s new lunar mission, NASA’s Artemis missions joining hands with SpaceX and Blue Origin to land humans on the moon again and the rise of new private space agencies and international organizations…the whole scene just got a lot better.<br>Elon
        Musk has already talked about colonizing moon and mars trying to follow Cooper’s saying in Interstellar- “mankind was born on earth. It was never meant to die here.”<br>So, will we ever colonize moon and make visiting the moon possible to everyone…or
        will we eventually leave our closest neighbor alone and move on to other planets and solar systems?<br><br><br></p>
