    <p class="text-center" style="margin: 0px 30px;">Don’t worry. I am not going to make a speech from the commonreasons-<br><br>for-becoming-an-entrepreneur- list like Freedom, Selfrespect,<br><br>sense of adventure, etc.<br><br>Instead, I am going to share with you what I told my mom when<br><br>she
        listened to me answer briefly to the same question above for<br><br>45 minutes and said “There is only one Elon Musk who<br><br>succeeded”.<br><br>Let’s be honest. I am not a class topper or a science geek or a<br><br>Hari(the boy in my class
        who acts stupid but knows everything).I<br><br>am an average student…who was very scared to go out of his<br><br>comfort zone…with very supportive parents who want me to<br><br>become a normal engineer with a normal job…with huge salary.<br><br>But
        everything changed when one day my whole family decided<br><br>to take a vacation together at Kodaikanal.<br><br>The Kodaikanal Incident<br><br>The five-day trip which was really exciting at first suddenly crash<br><br>landed to becoming one of
        the worst memories I have.<br><br>That was also the first time I realized that my cousins were so<br><br>competitive that they would even calculate the fourth decimal<br><br>point of their percentage marks to determine who was<br><br>ahead….Seriously…I
        watched it happen.<br><br>This wasn’t the problem. The problem was when they turned their<br><br>heads towards me…I had nothing. Even the prizes that I got for<br><br>the State level arts festival didn’t cushion the blows.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because
        those weren’t “achievements”.<br><br>Then they started giving me suggestions on what to become…<br><br>ranging from a bank manager to a rocket scientist.<br><br>That’s when my uncle Santosh said, “Be something that no one in<br><br>our family
        has ever become”.<br><br>Yeah…I am going to be someone who doesn’t care about what<br><br>their family want them to be and write my own story.<br><br>Of course I didn’t say this out loud and I think Uncle Santosh<br><br>actually meant being an
        astronaut or a formula one racer…but I<br><br>decided to take that suggestion into my head.<br><br>The Elon Musk factor<br><br>From dropping out of Stanford University to becoming the world’s<br><br>31st richest person and being called the “Real
        Life Ironman”. How<br><br>cool is that!!<br><br>Stumbling across Ashlee Vance’s biography of Elon Musk was<br><br>one of the best things that ever happened to me. Seeing how a<br><br>man with a vision, change the world with nothing but technology,<br><br>made
        him the John McClane to my Jake Peralta.<br><br>After reading and understanding more and more…being an<br><br>entrepreneur was like performing a magic trick to me. People first<br><br>thinking nothing was going to work and finally getting their
        minds<br><br>blown away…was the perfect way to show my family and the world what dreams can win.<br><br>After all…even the most selfless choices and decisions are born out of a personal experience...and success is not only born out of brilliance
        or determination…but out of necessity too.<br><br>Conclusion<br><br>I want to be an entrepreneur because I want to be a magician.<br><br>I want to watch people gasp as the swords go inside the box, and see them applaud as I emerge unharmed from
        the other end.<br><br>I want to see people laugh and feel sorry when I fall down climbing the mountain, and see them cheer for me and proudly hold my hand up when I reach the peak.<br><br>I don’t care if there’s only one Elon Musk. I chase my
        dreams to carve my own name on the stone…so that I can watch boys and girls like me read my story and gain strength to say, Abracadabra.<br></p>
