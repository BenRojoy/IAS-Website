    <p style="margin: 0px 30px;"><br><em>My ears were hurting. I could still feel the heat of the conversation I had before I hung up my phone. In 16 hours, the link for submitting the final abstract of our idea for the Pitch-An-Idea contest was going to close. Even though we knew what we should do, the answer to “How?” still remained pretty blurred. Suddenly it struck me. Maybe I should call Hareesh and ask him about this… after all he works for a company who does similar kind of projects right?!…</em>When
        Nikhita, our IEEE chairperson, asked me if I wanted to be a part of an Alumni Connect program, I immediately said yes. Even she was surprised that she didn’t have to give the speech which she had prepared so that i could get the true purpose and
        working methods of the program. The reason for this was that i already had this in my mind.That night, when I called Hareesh,&nbsp;who was actually my cousin and an Alumnus of my college, It actually felt similar to the time when I discovered
        Google search engine. He gave a lot of inputs to help me and also connected me to other alumni who worked in the same field. With all their help, we were able to put up a cool abstract and (yes, I am taking this opportunity to brag that..) a presentation
        with which we went on to bag the first prize and a funding to bring that dream of ours to reality.Even after that, for all the projects which me and my team worked on, Alumni kind of acted as the catalyst for the successful&nbsp;results. Alumni
        like Raoof Naushad, Harshitha, Rishi and Sujith (who I met through the Alumni connect program) played important roles in all our works.That was when I began to think of how wonderful it would be if all my fellow classmates got the same opportunity
        to connect with them.We all joined this course for different reasons. Some, to build up a strong career in the stream… some, just because their entrance marks let them take this course.. And some, who just didn’t even have a single clue what they
        were going to do..and joined the course as their parents held their hands and dragged them into the college on the admission day that it nearly gave him/her a flashback to their first day at kindergarten(Me).But as we go deep into this.. We all
        find our way ourselves… and sometimes.. A helping hand is all that it takes for you to take off.Two years into this engineering life, when I fell in love with this course.. I was lucky that there was someone to connect me to the vast network of
        Alumni. But there are a bunch of students who are way smarter than me.. waiting for that push so that their ideas can fly too.This is the reason why I jumped right into the boat when Nikhita told me about the Alumni Connect program. Along with
        Arundhathi, Naveen,&nbsp;Gowri&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;rest&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;team.&nbsp;.. I believe that we can help and inspire our college to uplift their ideas and dreams and guide them to forge better career paths in order to become better
        professionals and individuals.<br><br></p>
