    <p style="margin: 0px 30px;"><br><strong>Can video gaming really help to solve problems in the world?</strong> <em>“A game is an opportunity to focus our energy, with relentless optimism, at something we’re good at (or getting better at) and enjoy. In other words, the gameplay is the direct emotional opposite of depression.”― Jane McGonigal</em><br><br><br><br>It
        was in the World Innovation Forum, where the keynote speaker Jane McGonigal, a professional game developer, addressed the need to pose extending World dilemmas to the gaming community to foster their creative ideas and methodologies to save the
        World. Sources reveal that more than a billion people in the World engage in video games per hour a day due to the cognitive stimulation which is seemingly absent in real-life 9-5 jobs and syllabus oriented educational principles where individuals
        are partly disengaged. Surprisingly, the World's largest community happens to be "Angry birds" which underwent 1 billion downloads surpassing the number of Facebook users. This indicates the participants of the gaming community, being diverse
        in all aspects Hence, posing a real-life challenge to the gaming community and channelling the time invested in solving the world's problems could yield tremendous results. <strong>VIDEO GAMES AS SOLUTION-YIELDERS</strong> Ever heard of a collaborative
        video-game called Foldit? It was a remarkable moment in history when researchers were unable to determine the structure of the protein that caused AIDs in rhesus monkeys. The research which lasted for 10 years came to an end when scientists of
        the University of Washington developed Foldit, an elaborate video game where the gamers were able to crack the protein structure in just a matter of 10 days. A 2010 paper in the science journal Nature credited Foldit's 57,000 players with providing
        useful results that outperformed algorithmically computed solutions.<br> <strong>       2.  WHEN VIDEO-GAMES ESTABLISHED UNITY</strong> There was a time when 'Conspiracy For Good', a transcommunication basic video game founded by Tim Kring with
        the support of Nokia brought together millions of people from around the World. The mobile game had 9 million users globally who came together, met each other at streets of London after 4 weeks of gaming and put their entire effort in fulfilling
        the goal of the game, which was to stock an African library with books for the students. The participants took things to the next level by taking tasks such as cleaning several community parks seriously, constructing 5 additional libraries, funding
        50 scholarships for schoolgirls and generating over 10,000 books for the Zambian libraries through WeGiveBooks.org. This was a key event that occurred and received global attention as it enhanced the opportunities harvested through video games
        that could result in community-welfare.<br><br> <strong>   3.  BRIDGING EMOTIONAL CREVICES</strong> Video games were once specifically customized for children for fun. The evolution of video games which range from the simple 'Pong', run on IBM
        1560s to the latest PUBG, Minecraft or League of legends with international networking among participants is a commendable one. Although most trending video games help relieve stress, games such as 'Champions of the Shengha' are exclusively created
        for calming our mind. The fact though remains intact that, unlike good old days, kids don't get the fair chance to mingle along and play outdoor as the residence in this era is dispersed. Video games promote the creation of a network of friends
        through the game, which can be comforting and may also be empowering. <br><br> <strong>4.     GAMING FOR EDUCATION </strong> Cooperative gameplay has proved to develop problem-solving skills, team spirit, optimism, confidence and acceptance towards
        failures. Curriculum-based educational systems have relied upon games considering the diminished concentration among pupils. Engaging students by incorporating games within lessons keeps them focused. Nevertheless, the objective of the educational
        systems is the create a generation adaptable and skillful. Todays' children are tomorrows' promise. Hence its necessary to teach them in a way they are comfortable. When we have discussed alot about the positive attributes of video games, it's
        equally essential to understand that the virtual world you witness out there is truly engaging but unreal. When you find yourself getting addicted, you must stay alert and away from the screen. Where on one hand, video games can create a better
        tomorrow and on the other hand, it can cripple you by taking your attention far away from reality. Stay safe!<br><br></p>
