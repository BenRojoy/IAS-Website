    <p class="text-center" style="margin: 0px 30px;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br><br>Robotics is an<br>intersection of science and technology that produces a machine with a specific<br>task to or a complex series of actions to perform.&nbsp; The evolution of robotics along with<br>nanotechnology
        leads to the evolution of nanobots and nanites. These are kinds<br>of nanoparticle sized robots which are assigned to do a particular task. They<br>are the key to fight against some of the complicated disease like. Nanites are<br>self-replicating
        bio-engineered nano robots which undergo binary cell fission<br>when they reach their target.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>NANOBOTS: AN</strong><br><strong>EFFECTIVE REMEDY</strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Nanobots, which<br>are 50-100 nm
        wide, also, carry out a specific function. As a pandemic grips<br>the world, even doctors may forget about the threats of spreading this corona<br>virus while they treat their patients. So, we introduce nanites or nanobots in<br>order to help
        doctors enhance their treatment methods to cure this<br>disease.&nbsp; <br><br>Corona virus<br>primarily infect the lungs and in severe cases causes death due to ARDS (Acute<br>Respiratory Distress Syndrome), which impact the lungs and damages
        the alveoli<br>(tiny air sacs) by thickening the thin walls of alveoli thus impairing the<br>transfer of oxygen to the red blood cells causing difficulty in breathing as<br>the body is running short of oxygen which affects other internal organs.&nbsp;
        <br><br>Another cause of<br>death is due to pneumonia, another lung disease caused due to the inflammation<br>air sacs in one or both lungs. In this case the air sacs may fill with pus. As<br>this virus can spread through direct or indirect contact,
        doctors or other<br>healthcare workers would face a great threat .So, in order to avoid this risk,<br>we will release nanobots.&nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Since Corona virus cause infection in lungs,<br>serious patients will be using ventilators
        as they take over the bodyâ€™s<br>breathing process or just support lungs for the intake and release of oxygen<br>and carbon dioxide from the lungs. Through the breath delivery unit, as<br>aerosols or as injectable forms we will direct nanobots
        with magnetic field to<br>the alveoli located in the alveolar sacs of the lungs in the pulmonary lobules<br>of the respiratory zone. These nanobots can be used as portals for transport of<br>antiviral drugs under research or as portals for antibodies
        available at<br>present against the corona virus antigens (molecular targeted therapy). When<br>they reach their target nanobots self-replicate and in the blood stream and<br>they recognize the virus carrying the target antigen. This will intiate
        a<br>cascade of antigen antibody reaction resulting in virus destroy. Similarly the<br>antiviral drug carrying nanobots deployed as aerosols through the aerosol will<br>reach the lung alveoli and destroy the virus. After performing its function,<br>nanobots
        will self-destruct and dissolves. <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br><strong>NANOBOTS FOR</strong><br><strong>A BETTER TOMMOROW</strong><br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>These<br>nanorobotic technologies can not only be used to treat lung disease but also<br>could be
        used for treating every other disease when researched upon and<br>developed properly. We can await a time when Nano robotic can even perform a<br>surgery without creating any incision in the skin. <br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
