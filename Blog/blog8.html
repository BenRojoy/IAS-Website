    <p class="text-center" style="margin: 0px 30px;">CRYPTOCURRENCY<br><br>Before going to the whole concept of, What a ‘Cryptocurrency’ is I would like<br><br>to enlighten about the current social need and the uplifting question, ‘Why<br><br>do we need Cryptocurrency and Why does it matter?’<br><br>Currently,
        our everyday financial transactions rely upon a trusted third party<br><br>to maintain a record of transactions. For example, when you do a bank<br><br>transaction, the banking system keeps a record, a ledger &amp; guarantees that<br><br>the transaction
        is safe &amp; reliable. Likewise, when person ‘A’ transfers 10 to<br><br>person ‘B’ using PayPal, PayPal maintains a central record of 10 dollars<br><br>debited from A’s account and $10 credited to B’s. Intermediaries like banks,<br><br>PayPal,
        and other members of the current economic system play an<br><br>important role in regulating the world’s financial transactions.<br><br>The main question that arises is that are these intermediaries required, are<br><br>these records and guarantees
        reliable and false-proof. Ok let me show you<br><br>some of the limitations of these intermediaries,<br><br>1. Unfair value capture : These intermediaries gain billions of dollars in wealth creation<br><br>but pass virtually nothing onto their
        customers to show any kind of satisfaction or<br><br>regard.<br><br>2. Fees : Banks and companies charge nominal fees for facilitating transactions. These<br><br>fees often disproportionately impact lower-income earning groups who have the<br><br>fewest
        alternatives and find it hard to meet the two ends.<br><br>3. Censorship : If a particularly trusted intermediary decides that you should not be<br><br>able to move your money, it can place restrictions on the movement of your money.<br><br>(account
        freezing)<br><br>4. Permissioned : The trusted intermediary serves as a gatekeeper who can arbitrarily<br><br>prevent anybody from being part of the network.<br><br>5. Pseudonymous : At a time when the issue of privacy is gaining greater urgency,<br><br>these
        powerful gatekeepers can disclose -- or force you to disclose -- more financial<br><br>information about yourself than you may want. (wrapping up the factor of privacy)<br><br>So everything has a beginning, and the whole concept and application
        of<br><br>cryptocurrency transpire during the ‘2008 International Financial Crisis’<br><br>which essentially gave birth to the revolutionary idea Blockchain. You can’t<br><br>talk about cryptocurrency without mentioning blockchain. The financial<br><br>crisis
        was primarily caused by deregulation in the financial industry. That<br><br>permitted banks to engage in hedge fund trading with derivatives. Banks<br><br>then demanded more mortgages to support the profitable sale of these<br><br>derivatives,
        which indirectly created the financial crisis that led to the Great<br><br>Recession . This was one of the main reasons which question the reliability of<br><br>these intermediaries.<br><br>So how do blockchain and cryptocurrency relate to each
        other, Blockchain<br><br>is the technology that enables the existence of Cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is<br><br>one of the most popular cryptocurrency out there in the market. Bitcoin’s<br><br>“peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” launched in 2009
        by an anonymous<br><br>programmer (or group) Satoshi Nakamoto, was a watershed moment for the<br><br>freedom of money. For the first time in history, people could securely<br><br>exchange value, without requiring a third party or trusted intermediary.<br><br>Payment
        in Bitcoin meant that people could pay each other directly,<br><br>bypassing institutional fees, obstructions, and intrusions. Bitcoin was truly a<br><br>currency without boundaries, powering, and connecting a new global<br><br>economy.<br><br>So
        let us refresh the idea of cryptocurrency, A cryptocurrency is a digital or<br><br>virtual currency that is meant to be a medium of exchange. Rewinding to<br><br>the past we had different modes of currencies, in the initial stage, we had a<br><br>Barter
        System which was an exchange of commodities and had too many<br><br>demerits such as people’s requirements should coincide and no common<br><br>measure of values. So by 110 BC official currency (coins) were launched and<br><br>the transformation
        of currency rapidly took place from coins to paper to<br><br>digital wallets it was so simple. But there always existed a common factor<br><br>that was, third party Governing Bodies that acted as the medium for the<br><br>circulation and regulation
        of money in the society. These intermediaries face<br><br>some issues some of them were mentioned above and others include<br><br>transactional errors, technical issues, user account being hacked, and<br><br>transfer limits for account.<br><br>Thus
        revolutionary was the idea of cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency has a<br><br>limit to how many units can exist thus improving the factor of<br><br>decentralization and the Halving Effect was a part of this key feature.<br><br>Cryptocurrency has many
        key features and these includes:<br><br>● Transfer of funds can be easily verifiable.<br><br>● Operates independently of the banks.<br><br>● Allows new units to be added after certain criteria are met.<br><br>● No transactional costs<br><br>●
        24/7 money access.<br><br>● Freedom of use.<br><br>● International Money transfer is faster.<br><br>The Crypto in Cryptocurrency .<br><br>Cryptography is a method of using encryption to secure connection in the<br><br>presence of a third party
        with ill intent. So cryptocurrency uses many<br><br>essential cryptography features like;<br><br>● Computational Algorithm, like SHA256 which is a one-way encryption.<br><br>● A public key - which the user shares with everyone.<br><br>● A private
        key - a digital signature of the user.<br><br>S o how does it work ?<br><br>During a transaction, the details are encrypted using the hashing algorithm<br><br>like SHA256 passed along with users private key to initialize the<br><br>transactional
        process and thus with a digitally signed output which is<br><br>distributed across the networks along with users public key and as a final<br><br>process verification is done and is added to the block. This may sound quite<br><br>weird but the
        actual process is simple and happens faster and there is no<br><br>third party Governance.<br><br>Proof of Work: A proof-of-work system is a consensus mechanism. It deters<br><br>denial-of-service attacks and other service abuses such as spam
        on a network<br><br>by requiring some work from the service requester, usually meaning<br><br>processing time by a computer. Thus this ensures the safety and hackproof<br><br>mechanism of a blockchain and transfer capabilities of cryptocurrency.<br><br>Usually,
        this is done by solving a mathematical complex problem commonly<br><br>termed as mining which is done so, in fact, to regulate and maintain the<br><br>decentralization system in Blockchain and the user is awarded a certain<br><br>amount for solving
        the computational problem.<br><br>Popular cryptocurrencies include Bitcoin and Ethereum and both of them<br><br>have different use cases, Bitcoin is mainly used for the purchase of<br><br>commodities and has higher transactional and mining values
        and the last<br><br>Bitcoin to be mined will be probably by 2140. While in the case of Ethereum<br><br>it is used in the Ethereum network to deploy and maintain decentralized<br><br>applications.<br><br>Future:<br><br>There have been large conflicts
        between regulation and anonymity of<br><br>cryptocurrency, both sides have major supporters and oppressors, many<br><br>tries to relate the anonymity of blockchain and cryptocurrency to<br><br>questioning relations to terrorism and all. There
        are requests to put out<br><br>governing bodies to regulate the working of cryptocurrency, but this<br><br>indirectly moves against the whole idea of why it started. Putting these<br><br>complications aside Cryptocurrency has a bright future,
        its said that by 2030<br><br>cryptocurrencies shall occupy 25% of national currencies. It shall be<br><br>acceptable worldwide and by everyone and still maintaining its volatile<br><br>nature intact.<br></p>
